Specifically, analytical approaches for the characterization of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of healthy foods and functional constituents, as well as technological strategies for the extraction of compounds and fractions from raw materials to produce anti-inflammatory and antioxidant ingredients are addressed. In addition, the molecular mechanisms by which foods and their components can modulate inflammation and their oxidative stress effects on disease prevention are explored. Finally, clinical research addressing nutritional needs in pathological subjects with inflammatory diseases are considered. - Covers methods of analysis and extraction of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds - Offers an overview of the main anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds in foods - Provides a guide on the mechanisms of action and health benefits of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant dietary bioactives",

        "description": "Fermentation-based processing advanced with global food systems as humanity started to organize the domestication of agriculture from plant and animal sources. These advances emerged across regions of the world from river valley civilizations in Asia (Mesopotamia, India and China) and Africa (Egypt) to Meso-American civilizations. As food crops and animal foods emerged from domestication to advancements in post-harvest processing stages, growth of invisible microbial systems led to modified foods that aligned with local palates of the communities. This in several cases became part of food systems, as it added a mode of preservation and improved the food quality that was preferred by each community. This is how the early genesis of fermented foods from grains, fruits and vegetables to animal meats and milk products became an integral part of early civilizations over 4000 years ago and has now carried over and further developed across many countries in every region of the world. The foundations of these food fermentations are now an integral part of modern food advances as preferred food substrates and the microbial interactions that drive the metabolic processes in defined food matrixes are being scientifically advanced. This book focuses on bringing together diverse emergences and advancements of fermented foods across different regions of the world and how the metabolic processes associated with fermentation in several cases add health-relevant functional qualities across different food matrixes. This book contains 26 chapters from the Americas, Africa, Europe and Asia, bringing together the fermentation processes of diverse food substrates and their microbial processing and in several cases providing health-targeted functional benefits. Key Features: Discusses the rationale and basis of fermented food systems from across 26 diverse regions of the world with examples from the Americas, Asia, Europe and Africa Presents historical plant and animal food substrates and the metabolic processes of their fermentation across traditions of a range of countries Covers traditional food fermentations across diverse food substrates that have potentially health-relevant functional benefits Reflects and presents the role of historical, cultural and traditional food concepts of a diverse range of countries with many novel examples and how they have influenced health-relevant functional benefits Discusses the relevance of metabolic concepts of fermented and functional foods in advancing healthy food concepts This book is important for food scientists, nutritionists and the health care sector, but beyond this, it is also relevant for a wider global audience interested in a holistic health approach from food systems where examples of fermentation experience can inform new natural processing strategies to improve food quality and health.",

        "description": "The only single-source reference on the science of olives and olive oil nutrition and health benefits Olives and Olive Oil as Functional Foods is the first comprehensive reference on the science of olives and olive oil. While the main focus of the book is on the fruit’s renowned health-sustaining properties, it also provides an in-depth coverage of a wide range of topics of vital concern to producers and researchers, including post-harvest handling, packaging, analysis, sensory evaluation, authentication, waste product utilization, global markets, and much more. People have been cultivating olives for more than six millennia, and olives and olive oil have been celebrated in songs and legends for their life-sustaining properties since antiquity. However, it is only within the last several decades that the unique health benefits of their consumption have become the focus of concerted scientific studies. It is now known that olives and olive oil contain an abundance of phenolic antioxidants, as well as the anti-cancer compounds such as squalene and terpenoids. This centerpiece of the Mediterranean diet has been linked to a greatly reduced risk of heart disease and lowered cancer risk. Bringing together contributions from some of the world’s foremost experts on the subject, this book: Addresses the importance of olives and olive oil for the agricultural economy and the relevance of its bioactive components to human health Explores the role that olive oil plays in reducing oxidative stress in cells-a well-known risk factor in human health Provides important information about new findings on olive oil and lipids which reviews the latest research Explores topics of interest to producers, processors, and researchers, including the fruit’s chemical composition, processing considerations, quality control, safety, traceability, and more Edited by two scientists world-renowned for their pioneering work on olive oil and human health, this book is an indispensable source of timely information and practical insights for agricultural and food scientists, nutritionists, dieticians, physicians, and all those with a professional interest in food, nutrition, and health.",

        "description": "Governance, security, and development are three critical components of a dialectical nexus that is both dominant and determinant for any objective and fruitful quest for the understanding of the trajectory of a country, a region or, in the case of Africa, a continent from a colonial past to a neocolonial and meta-colonial present, and toward a future of strategic optimal independence and self-reliance. That colonial past and the ensuing neocolonial and meta-colonial present have made these critical components and the dialectical nexus that they form particularly challenging for the African continent. For this reason, Issues of Governance, Security and Development in Contemporary Africa offers an in-depth, interdisciplinary analysis of the challenges that contemporary Africa faces within these critical areas, as well as the resources and prospects that the continent possesses and can leverage to overcome the said challenges. Using case studies involving a range of countries across the continent, Mohamed Saliou Camara, Alem Hailu, and Sabella O. Abidde argue that Africa needs to decolonize the terms of reference that guide its nation-building, statecraft, and national development agenda in ways that will facilitate the establishment of viable systems of governance and security, and the promotion of genuine development.",

Thus achieving high prosperity in your professional, personal and family life! The nutritional coaching book is a work that addresses the integration of coaching techniques in the context of nutrition. It aims to offer a holistic approach to achieving goals related to food and health. Nutritional coaching combines coaching principles, such as goal setting, identifying obstacles and developing strategies, with nutrition knowledge. The main objective of nutritional coaching is to help individuals make more conscious and healthy eating choices, promoting lasting changes in their eating habits. The book can offer practical guidance, reflection exercises and strategies for dealing with common food-related challenges, such as binges, poor choices and lack of motivation. By incorporating coaching into the field of nutrition, the book seeks not only to provide information about diets and nutrition, but also to develop self-management skills, self-awareness and empowerment of the individual in relation to their food choices. Therefore, nutritional coaching serves as a transformative approach that aims not just at momentary change, but at building healthy habits that are sustainable over the long term.",

It incorporates narrative, lexical and grammatical field results over the last three decades. Treated are morphology, syntax and argument structure after an introductory phonology and orthographic overview highlighting grammatical and lexical tone. Individual chapters delineate noun and verb phrase structure as well as clause shape in discourse and clause combination. Noun inflection and derivation are detailed as is verb inflection in the context of tense, aspect and modality. Noun phrase character encompasses remnant noun classes, nominal modification types and pronoun forms followed by conjunction. Verb phrase features include complex predicates, both verbs in series and verb plus postverbal particle, functionally distinct copulas, double objects, and sentence complement types constrained by matrix verb. Also analyzed are preverbal and postverbal adverbials relative to information question types. Multi-clause constructions are profiled as to coding varieties across dependent clauses as well as precedence relations. A concluding chapter presents a sample narrative in orthographic form, interlinear gloss and English free translation.",

Growing energy demand is the main cause of environmental pollution, but the efficient use of renewable resources and technologies for residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural sectors offers the opportunity to diminish energy dependence, ensure efficiency and reliability, reduce pollutant emissions, and buoy national economies. Eco-friendly energy processes are the key to long-term sustainability. Eco-Friendly Energy Processes and Technologies for Achieving Sustainable Development is a collection of innovative research that identifies sustainability pillars such as environmental, technical, social, institutional, and economic disciplines and explores the longevity of these disciplines through a resource-oriented approach. Featuring coverage of a broad range of topics including environmental policy, corporate accountability, and urban planning, this book is ideally designed for policymakers, urban planners, engineers, advocates, researchers, academicians, and students.",

Popular books and films about food production and consumption are exposing the unintended consequences of the standard American diet. Questions about the principles and values that ought to guide decisions about dinner have become urgent for moral, ecological, and health-related reasons. In Philosophy Comes to Dinner, twelve philosophers—some leading voices, some inspiring new ones—join the conversation, and consider issues ranging from the sustainability of modern agriculture, to consumer complicity in animal exploitation, to the pros and cons of alternative diets.",

        "description": "Thinking on development informs and inspires the actions of people, organizations, and states in their continuous effort to invent a better world. This volume examines the ideas behind development: their origins, how they have changed and spread over time, and how they may evolve over the coming decades. It also examines how the real-life experiences of different countries and organizations have been inspired by, and contributed to, thinking on development. The extent to which development 'works' depends in part on particular local, historical, or institutional contexts. General policy prescriptions fail when the necessary conditions that make them work are either absent, ignored, or poorly understood. There is a need to grasp how people understand their own development experience. If the countries of the world are varied in every way, from their initial conditions to the degree of their openness to outside money and influence, and success is not centred in any one group, it stands to reason that there cannot be a single recipe for development. Each chapter provides an analytical survey of thinking about development that highlights debates and takes into account critical perspectives. It includes contributions from scholars and practitioners from the global North and the global South, spanning at least two generations and multiple disciplines. It will be a key reference on the concepts and theories of development - their origins, evolution, and trajectories - and act as a resource for scholars, graduate students, and practitioners.",

Each have become symbolic foods with specific connotations, located to a very specific place and country. This book explores the role of food in society as a means of interrogating the concept of the nation-state and its sub-units, and reveals how the nation-state in its various disguises has been and is changing in response to accelerated globalisation. The chapters investigate various stages of national food: its birth, emergence, and decline, and why sometimes no national food emerges. By collecting and analysing a wide range of case studies from countries including Portugal, Mexico, the USA, Bulgaria, Scotland, and Israel, the book illustrates ways in which various social forces work together to shape social and political realities concerning food. The contributors, hailing from anthropology, history, sociology and political science, investigate the significance of specific food cultures, cuisines, dishes, and ingredients, and their association with national identity. In so doing, it becomes clearer how these two things interact, and demonstrates the scope and direction of the current study of food and nationalism.",

        "description": "Navigating government documents is a task that requires considerable knowledge of specialized terms and acronyms. This required knowledge nearly amounts to knowing a completely different language. To those who are not fluent, the task can be overwhelming, as federal departments fill their documents with acronyms, abbreviations, and terms that mean little or nothing to the outsider. Would you be able to make sense of a document that described how the COTR reports to the CO regarding compliance with FAR, GPRA, SARA, and FASA? (This is a common procedure in government contracting.) Would you have any clue what was being referred to if you came across MIL-STD-129P? (It is the new standard for Military Shipping Label Requirements.) The sheer number of such terms makes mastering them nearly impossible. But now, these terms and their definitions are within reach. A Guide to Federal Terms and Acronyms presents a glossary of key definitions used by the Federal Government. This reference guide is comprehensive, covering the most common terms, acronyms, and abbreviations used by each major Federal Government agency. And it is also accessible, organized in a logical, easy-to-use format. Users can look up terms and acronyms by department or subject matter, making this a quick reference for translating government language. This is an essential tool for anyone who works with federal government information.",

        "description": "Spray drying is a well-established method for transforming liquid materials into dry powder form. Widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries, this technology produces high quality powders with low moisture content, resulting in a wide range of shelf stable food and other biologically significant products. Encapsulation technology for bioactive compounds has gained momentum in the last few decades and a series of valuable food compounds, namely flavours, carotenoids and microbial cells have been successfully encapsulated using spray drying. Spray Drying Technique for Food Ingredient Encapsulation provides an insight into the engineering aspects of the spray drying process in relation to the encapsulation of food ingredients, choice of wall materials, and an overview of the various food ingredients encapsulated using spray drying. The book also throws light upon the recent advancements in the field of encapsulation by spray drying, i.e., nanospray dryers for production of nanocapsules and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. Addressing the basics of the technology and its applications, the book will be a reference for scientists, engineers and product developers in the industry.",

        "description": "There’s never been a better time to be prepared. “This book is an indispensable basic manual for the real-life issues that await us in the decades to come. . . [A] treasure trove of practical wisdom.”—James Howard Kunstler, author of The Geography of Nowhere Matthew Stein’s comprehensive primer on sustainable living skills—from food and water to shelter and energy to first-aid and crisis-management skills—prepares you to embark on the path toward sustainability. But unlike any other book, Stein not only shows you how to live green in seemingly stable times, but to live in the face of potential disasters, lasting days or years, coming in the form of social upheaval, economic meltdown, or environmental catastrophe. When Technology Fails covers the gamut. Inside, you’ll learn: The basics of installing a renewable energy system for your home or business How to find and sterilize water in the face of utility failure How to keep warm if you’ve been left temporarily homeless Practical information for dealing with water-quality issues Alternative health and first-aid techniques Each chapter describes skills for self-reliance in good times and bad. Chapters Include: A survey of the risks to the status quo Supplies and preparation for short- and long-term emergencies Emergency measures for survival Prepping water, food, shelter, and clothing First aid, low-tech medicine, and healing Securing energy, heat, and power Metalworking Utensils and storage Low-tech chemistry engineering, machines, and materials Fully revised and expanded, When Technology Fails ends on a positive, proactive note with a chapter on “Making the Shift to Sustainability,” which offers practical suggestions for changing our world on personal, community and global levels. \"When Technology Fails is a massive project done well. First the book gives a superb presentation of WHY one should be more aware and prepared--and then HOW one should go about this. The scope of this book... is thorough.\"—John McPherson, author, Primitive Wilderness Living and Survival Skills",

        "description": "\"Like Jane Goodall’s studies of chimps, Ben Kilham’s work with black bears is more than just revealing: it’s revolutionary. . . Ben’s work will transform our understanding of how animals live—and how science should be done.\"—Sy Montgomery, author of The Soul of an Octopus In In the Company of Bears, originally published in hardcover as Out on a Limb, Ben Kilham invites us into the world he has come to know best: the world of black bears. For decades, Kilham has studied wild black bears in a vast tract of Northern New Hampshire woodlands. At times, he has also taken in orphaned infants–feeding them, walking them through the forest for months to help them decipher their natural world, and eventually reintroducing them back into the wild. Once free, the orphaned bears still regard him as their mother. And one of these bears, now a 17-year-old female, has given him extraordinary access to her daily life, opening a rare window into how she and the wild bears she lives among carry out their daily lives, raise their young, and communicate. Witnessing this world has led to some remarkable discoveries. For years, scientists have considered black bears to be mostly solitary. Kilham’s observations, though, reveal the extraordinary interactions wild bears have with each other. They form friendships and alliances; abide by a code of conduct that keeps their world orderly; and when their own food supplies are ample, they even help out other bears in need. Could these cooperative behaviors, he asks, mimic behavior that existed in the animal that became human? In watching bears, do we see our earliest forms of communications unfold? Kilham’s dyslexia once barred him from getting an advanced academic degree, securing funding for his research, and publishing his observations in the scientific literature. After being shunned by the traditional scientific community, though, Kilham’s unique findings now interest bear researchers worldwide. His techniques even aid scientists working with pandas in China and bears in Russia. Moreover, the observation skills that fueled Kilham’s exceptional work turned out to be born of his dyslexia. His ability to think in pictures and decipher systems makes him a unique interpreter of the bear’s world. In the Company of Bears delivers Kilham’s fascinating glimpse at the inner world of bears, and also makes a passionate case for science, and education in general, to open its doors to different ways of learning and researching–doors that could lead to far broader realms of discovery.",
